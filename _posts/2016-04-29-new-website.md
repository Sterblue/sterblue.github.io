Our new website is online! This website was designed by [Crubier][crubier], it is based on [Jekyll][jekyll] and the [Spectral][spectral] theme. It comes as a replacement for our initial website which we made quickly in the beginning of the company. The old website looked like this:

The new website is more flexible and will allow a seamless integration with our cloud platform, when the time comes. We also opened a blog which we will use to share exciting public news in the upcoming months! The new website is responsive, it should work seamlessly on desktop and mobile platforms. Do not hesitate to [contact the webmaster][mail] if you encounter any issue.
