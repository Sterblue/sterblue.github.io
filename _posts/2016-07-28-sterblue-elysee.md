Last Friday, Sterblue was invited at [Palais de l'Elysée](http://www.elysee.fr/) to celebrate first anniversary of the [energy transition law](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichLoiPubliee.do?idDocument=JORFDOLE000029310724&type=general&legislature=14)! Other invitees included major energy players, politics and start-ups. All of them acting to make the transition a reality.

After a speech from President François Hollande, Sterblue could exchange with many other green and blue innovative project leaders!
